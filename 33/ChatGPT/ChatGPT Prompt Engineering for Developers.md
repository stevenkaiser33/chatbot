## This and all other lab notebooks of this course use OpenAI library version 0.27.0.

## In order to use the OpenAI library version 1.0.0, here is the code that you would use instead for the get_completion function:

client = openai.OpenAI()

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

## Prompting Principles
##  **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
##  **Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”**

### Tactics

#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
##  Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:

text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output

prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

#### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)


#### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting

prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)


### Principle 2: Give the model time to “think” 

#### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task

text = f"""
In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
continued exploring with delight.

print("\nCompletion for prompt 2:")
print(response)

#### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

prompt = f"""
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

Question:

 help working out the financials.

#### Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom

#### To install the OpenAI Python library:
#### ```
#### !pip install openai
#### ```

#### The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the [website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 

#### You can either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:
 #### ```
 #### !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
 #### ```

#### Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:

#### ```
#### import openai
#### openai.api_key = "sk-..."
#### 

A note about the backslash
In the course, we are using a backslash \ to make the text fit on the screen without inserting newline '\n' characters.
GPT-3 isn't really affected whether you insert newline characters or not. But when working with LLMs in general, you may consider whether newline characters in your prompt may affect the model's performance.


```

## Issue 1: The text is too long 
- Limit the number of words/sentences/characters.

## Issue 2. Text focuses on the wrong details
- Ask it to focus on the aspects that are relevant to the intended audience.

## Issue 3. Description needs a table of dimensions
- Ask it to extract information and organize it in a table.

# Transforming

In this notebook, we will explore how to use Large Language Models for text transformation tasks such as language translation, spelling and grammar checking, tone adjustment, and format conversion.

## Translation

ChatGPT is trained with sources in many languages. This gives the model the ability to do translation. Here are some examples of how to use this capability.

##Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom
#To install the OpenAI Python library:

!pip install openai
#The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the website.

#You can either set it as the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable before using the library:

 !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
#Or, set openai.api_key to its value:

import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."

## Setup
#### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.
#In this course, we've provided some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.

import os
import openai
import tiktoken
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']

#helper function
This may look familiar if you took the earlier course "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" Course.

Throughout this course, we will use OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model and the chat completions endpoint.

This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs.

Note: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to produce the desired results.

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output

# L4: Process Inputs: Chain of Thought Reasoning

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting



delimiter = "####"
system_message = f"""
Follow these steps to answer the customer queries.
The customer query will be delimited with four hashtags,\
i.e. {delimiter}. 

Step 1:{delimiter} First decide whether the user is \
asking a question about a specific product or products. \
Product cateogry doesn't count. 

Step 2:{delimiter} If the user is asking about \
specific products, identify whether \
the products are in the following list.
All available products: 
1. Product: TechPro Ultrabook
   Category: Computers and Laptops
   Brand: TechPro
   Model Number: TP-UB100
   Warranty: 1 year

   Warranty: 1 year
   Rating: 4.4
   Features: Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660
   Description: A powerful desktop computer for work and play.
   Price: $999.99

5. Product: BlueWave Chromebook

   Warranty: 1 year
   Rating: 4.1
   Features: 11.6-inch display, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, Chrome OS
   Description: A compact and affordable Chromebook for everyday tasks.
   Price: $249.99

Step 3:{delimiter} If the message contains products \
in the list above, list any assumptions that the \
user is making in their \
message e.g. that Laptop X is bigger than \
Laptop Y, or that Laptop Z has a 2 year warranty.

Step 4:{delimiter}: If the user made any assumptions, \
figure out whether the assumption is true based on your \
product information. 

Step 5:{delimiter}: First, politely correct the \
customer's incorrect assumptions if applicable. \
Only mention or reference products in the list of \
5 available products, as these are the only 5 \
products that the store sells. \
Answer the customer in a friendly tone.

Use the following format:
Step 1:{delimiter} <step 1 reasoning>
Step 2:{delimiter} <step 2 reasoning>
Step 3:{delimiter} <step 3 reasoning>
Step 4:{delimiter} <step 4 reasoning>
Response to user:{delimiter} <response to customer>

Make sure to include {delimiter} to separate every step.
